Lightpad
=========

**A simple editor, based on keyboard shortcuts**

**Disclaimer:** this README is written with Lightpad! ;)

Installation
------------

The only dependency required to build and run Lightpad, is GTK3.

Once the ridiculous amount of dependencies are installed, just run these commands to build and install Lightpad:

    $ make
    # make clean install

Keyboard shortcuts
--------------------

Lightpad is heavily based on a keyboard-based workflow: there are no graphical elements besides the tabs and the source view. To help you get going, there is a list
of the standard GtkSourceview keyboard shortcuts and some Gedit-specific ones [here][article].

Obviously, Lightpad supports all of the standard GtkSourceView shortcuts. Lightpad also tries to stay compatible to Gedit, except for features Lightpad does not have of course
(for example, spell checking and printing).
